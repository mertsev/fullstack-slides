Learning process
---

### **!!! It is implied that you learn most things on your own !!!**
# I share guides/videos for a certain topic and give an overview
# We do meetups 3 times a week
# Ask questions and help each other in chat
# Reach milestones at the end of every week so we're at the same pace (more often than a week if possible)


<!-- end_slide -->

Setting things up
---

# You need to set up development environment on your pc
* Chocolatey/brew (optionable but recommended)
* WSL2 (if you're on Windows)
* GIT
* NodeJS (at least current LTS)
* Docker
* VSCode
* Github account


<!-- end_slide -->

Setting things up
---

# You should be able to:
* Run a docker container
* Run a JavaScript file with Node
* Clone git repositories
